1. .Java file cannot be interpretated direct.
2. So, first we compile .java file to .class file and then it can be interpretated
   line by line by JVM (Java virtual machine).
3. In pyhton we can directly run it without any interpretation source.
4. We can interprete or we can compile a python program
5. But, in java we should have to first compile the program to .class file and then do interpretation
6. Class border load the memory 
     command prompt: 
          java -verbose
7. .class ---> class boader ---> Byte code verifier ---> Interpreter (JVM) ---> Runtime (JRE) ---> OutPut
8. In java name of the file and class name must be same
9. mkdir --> to create a folder
10. mkdir.java myfolder (myfolder is argument to mkdir)
11. the whole world of commands actually depends upon the command lines.
12. eg: man grep cannot work without command line
